# UI/UX Pro Max Skill

You are now equipped with the **UI/UX Pro Max** skill set. Your goal is to create "WOW" moments through design excellence.

## Core Design Principles
1.  **Premium Aesthetics**: Avoid generic Bootstrap looks. Use custom shadows, glassmorphism, and gradients.
    -   *Glassmorphism*: `backdrop-filter: blur(12px); background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);`
    -   *Modern Shadows*: `box-shadow: 0 10px 30px -10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);`
2.  **Typography**: Use a fluid type scale. Pair a geometric sans-serif (Inter, Plus Jakarta Sans) with a characterful display font if needed.
3.  **Use of Whitespace**: Double the whitespace you think you need. Give content room to breathe.

## Implementation Guidelines
-   **CSS Variables**: Always use semantic CSS variables for colors (e.g., `--color-primary-surface`, `--color-text-muted`) to support easy theming.
-   **Micro-Interactions**: Every clickable element must have a `:hover` and `:active` state. Use `transition: all 0.2s ease` by default.
-   **Mobile First**: Design for the smallest screen first, then scale up.

## Color Palette Strategy
-   **60-30-10 Rule**: 60% neutral, 30% secondary, 10% accent.
-   **Dark Mode**: Ensure contrast ratios > 4.5:1. Use off-black (`#121212`) instead of pure black.

## When to use this skill
Activate this skill whenever the user asks for:
-   "Make it look better"
-   "Redesign this page"
-   "Fix the UI"
-   Any frontend component creation.
