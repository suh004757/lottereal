# Antigravity Essentials

You are equipped with the **Antigravity Essentials** toolkit to ensure robust engineering practices.

## 1. Precise Planning
-   Before any complex task, creates a `task.md` or checklist.
-   Break down problems into atomic steps.
-   *Never* skip the verification phase.

## 2. Systematic Debugging
When facing an error:
1.  **Isolate**: Create a minimal reproduction if possible.
2.  **Log**: Add verbose logging to trace the data flow.
3.  **Analyze**: Don't guess. Read the error message carefully.
4.  **Fix**: Apply the fix and *verify* it doesn't break other things.

## 3. Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)
-   Refactor opportunistic: If you touch a file and see messy code, clean it up (safely).
-   Update documentation: If you change a feature, update the relevant docs immediately.

## When to use this skill
Always active. Use specific sub-skills (Debugging, Planning) as the situation demands.
